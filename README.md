# Final_Project
This project is an intelligent AI-powered shopping assistant designed to simulate a human-like shopping experience ；）
 Intent recognition trained from custom data (.csv) using scikit-learn

Context-aware dialogue that remembers and updates user preferences

Fuzzy matching for handling user input like “classic” → formal, “sneakers” → shoes

Dynamic recommendation guidance: asks about missing info naturally

Closure logic: supports confirmation, rejection, thank-you, and conversation reset

Fully implemented in Python, with modular, extendable code

Goal: Build a deployable intelligent product recommender (initially for fashion), capable of handling real-world ambiguity in language.
